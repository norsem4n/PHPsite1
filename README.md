# PHPsite1
First PHP site from scratch - under time constraint
NEEDS UPDATING:
•	Place order functionality is failing. The grade is based on the code.
•	Registering a new user doesn’t add the street address to the database
•	The modify account page doesn’t load the state information for the logged in user.

•	Delete an order functionality is not implemented.
•	Delete user from the system doesn’t clear the session and sign him out. 
•	When user is logging out, user can go to the modify account page by using the back button of the browser or entering the URL of that page with some errors. The application should redirects the user to the login page.
•	When user attempts to register with an existing username, the pages gets redirected to a blank page.

•	When user on the search results page and clicks on the view product link, it goes back to view all products page.
•	After modifying the account information successfully, the page goes to a new page with a successful message but can’t go back to the website unless I click on the back button of the browser.
•	The pages design still need some improvements.
