                        The economy, right? Can't live with it, can't live without it. All those numbers going up and down
                        just gets you stoked out of your mind to start the new day. No? It's okay, us neither. If your idea
                        of speculation involves wondering how sick its going to be next season, and you think IPO maybe stands 
                        for Initial Powder-day Opening, allow us to introduce you to your new broker. The Burton Day Trader 
                        Snowboard might not know a blue chip stock from a blue corn Tostito, but lay it over in some fluffy 
                        stuff and you'll see it's all about business. This smooth turning freeride stick floats higher than 
                        a bull market, and turns quicker than a short sale on the hardpack.

                <h4>Product Details</h4>

                <h5>Rocker Type</h5>
                <i>DIRECTIONAL FLAT TOP</i> - Flat overall with a rocker nose for the steady stability and effortless float
                demanded by deep days and surfy terrain.
                <br /><br />

                <h5>Flex</h5>
                <i>TWIN FLEX</i> - The flex is perfectly symmetrical from tip to tail for a balanced ride that's equally
                versatile regular or switch.
                <br /><br />

                <h5>Shape</h5>
                <i>DIRECTIONAL</i> - The classic snowboard shape, designed to be ridden with a slightly longer nose than
                tail to concentrate pop in the tail while still giving you plenty of float, flow, and control to rip any
                terrain or condition.
                <br /><br />
                <i>BALANCED FREERIDE TECH</i> - Balanced Freeride Geometry ends the debate between twin and directional
                with setback camber and a sidecut that is centered on your stance to create a twin freestyle feel when
                riding flat base. On edge it turns tight and quick with the float and prowess expected from a directional deck.
                <br /><br />
                <i>PRO-TIP</i> - A tapered tip and tail thickness reduces swing weight for easier mobility.
                <br /><br />

                <h5>Core</h5>
                <i>FSC - CERTIFIED SUPER FLY II 700G CORE</i> - Stronger and lighter woods target specific areas of the core
                to provide pop, strength, and reduced weight.
                <br /><br />
                <i>DUALZONE EGD</i> - The wood grain is positioned along the toe and heel edges on two continuous zones,
                perpendicular to the rest of the wood core for consistent edge-hold and added strength.
                <br /><br />
                <i>SQUEEZEBOX</i> - Burton's most versatile Squeezebox profile improves pop and performance through
                the balance of thicker, more powerful core sections with thinner, more flexible sections. Rider energy
                is transferred outward from beneath the feet, energizing the tip and tail while making the board snappier,
                more stable and easier to manipulate.
                <br /><br />

                <h5>Laminates</h5>
                <i>WOMENS SPECIFIC TRIAX FIBERGLASS</i> - Versatile flex and response for everything from mini to mega shred.
                <br /><br />

                <h5>Base</h5>
                <i>SINTERED BASE</i> - Durable and highly porous, get added durability and superior wax absorption for
                greater overall glide.
                <br /><br />

                <h5>Edges</h5>
                <i>FROSTBITE EDGES</i> - Frostbite extends out slightly beneath your bindings for tremendous edge-hold on 
                hard, icy conditions. Powerful when you need them, playful when you donâ€™t, Frostbite Edges are hungry for 
                hard-pack while remaining smooth, flowing, and forgiving.
